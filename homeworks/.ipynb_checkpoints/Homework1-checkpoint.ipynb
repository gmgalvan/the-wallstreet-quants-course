    "## Problem 1: Computing Dollar Profits 💰\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"pos\" dictionary below represents the dollars initially invested in each ticker. The \"ret\" dictionary represents the returns of each ticker\n",
    "- Please complete the function \"compute_profit\"\n",
    "- compute_profit takes as input \"pos\" and \"ret\" and should return a new dictionary that maps each ticker to the total dollar profit of that ticker (=ticker's return x dollars invested in ticker)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept Overview\n",
    "In finance, calculating the dollar profit or loss for each position is fundamental to portfolio management. This calculation helps us understand how much actual money we've made or lost on each investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Formula\n",
    "For each position, we calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Dollar Profit} = \\text{Position Size} \\times \\text{Return}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Explanation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Position    Return    Dollar Profit\n",
    "$1000       -1%       $1000 × (-0.01) = -$10    📉\n",
    "$500        +5%       $500 × (0.05) = $25       📈\n",
    "-$250       +1%       -$250 × (0.01) = -$2.5    📉\n",
    "$1200       +3%       $1200 × (0.03) = $36      📈\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ Interesting Finance Note\n",
    "For short positions (like BAC with -$250), a positive return results in a loss! This is because when you short a stock, you actually want the price to go down. It's like betting against the stock."
